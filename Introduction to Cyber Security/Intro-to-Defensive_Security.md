## Digital forensics process

Imagine a desk with : laptop, camera, computer, smartphone, SD cards, ... and you have to analyse all of this. The steps are :

## Practical Example

Refer to the room for the complete exercise.

To read PDF files with Kali Linux we can use `pdfinfo [filename.pdf]` (if you don't have it installed you can use `sudo apt install poppler-utils`

There are a lot of tools that allows you to read the EXIF data of an image.

In Linux there is : `exiftool [nameimage.jgp]` 

If you don't already have it installed on linux you can type : `sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl` 

# Security Operations

## Intro to SOC

A security operation center (SOC) is a team of IT security professionals tasked with monitoring a company’s network and systems 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

Their purpose of monitoring is to:

## Elements of SOC 

In this section we'll talk about : 

- Example data sources that the SOC relies on
- The services that the SOC provides
- An example scenario

### Data sources

### SOC services 

SOC services include reactive and proactive services in addition to other services.

#### Reactives Services

#### Proactives Services

Other services by the SOC include **cyber security training**. Many data breaches and intrusions can be avoided by raising users’ security awareness and arming them with solid security training.

### Example Scenario

One important role is **SOC Analyst** which is reponsible of network security monitoring and log management.

Let's consider the following scenario :
