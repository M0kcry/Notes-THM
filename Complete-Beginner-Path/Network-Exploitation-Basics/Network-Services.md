# Understanding SMB

SMB - Server Message Block Protocol - is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network. [source]

The SMB protocol is known as a response-request protocol, meaning that it transmits multiple messages between the client and server to establish a connection. Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI or IPX/SPX.

Once they have established a connection, clients can then send commands (SMBs) to the server that allow them to access shares, open files, read and write files, and generally do all the sort of things that you want to do with a file system. However, in the case of SMB, these things are done over the network.

**What runs SMB?**

Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows 95 have included client and server SMB protocol support. Samba, an open source server that supports the SMB protocol, was released for **Unix** systems.

# Enumerating SMBs

1. The first step of enumeration is to conduct a port scan, to find out as much information as you can about the services, applications, structure and operating system of the target machine.

2. Enum4linux is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares on both Windows and Linux systems. It is basically a wrapper around the tools in the Samba package and makes it easy to quickly extract information from the target pertaining to SMB. It's installed by default on Parrot and Kali, however if you need to install it, you can do so from the official github.

The syntax of Enum4Linux is nice and simple: **"enum4linux [option] ip"**

# Understanding Telnet

Telnet is an application protocol which allows you, with the use of a telnet client, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server.

The telnet client will establish a connection with the server. The client will then become a virtual terminal- allowing you to interact with the remote host.

The user connects to the server by using the Telnet protocol, which means entering "telnet" into a command prompt. The user then executes commands on the server by using specific Telnet commands in the Telnet prompt. You can connect to a telnet server with the following syntax: "telnet [ip] [port]"

# Enumerating 

Perform an nmap scan and see what is vulnerable, what protocol is allowing connection etc ..

# Understanding FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is, as the name suggests , a protocol used to allow remote transfer of files over a network. It uses a client-server model to do this, and- as we'll come on to later- relays commands and data in a very efficient way.

## Active vs Passive

The FTP server may support either Active or Passive connections, or both. 

In an Active FTP connection, the client opens a port and listens. The server is required to actively connect to it. 

In a Passive FTP connection, the server opens a port and listens (passively) and the client connects to it. 

This separation of command information and data into separate channels is a way of being able to send commands to the server without having to wait for the current data transfer to finish.

If both channels were interlinked, you could only enter commands in between data transfers, which wouldn't be efficient for either large file transfers, or slow internet connections.

# Enumerating FTP

By now, I don't think I need to explain any further how enumeration is key when attacking network services and protocols. You should, by now, have enough experience with nmap to be able to port scan effectively.

If you get stuck using any tool- you can always use "tool [-h / -help / --help]" to find out more about it's function and syntax. Equally, man pages are extremely useful for this purpose. They can be reached using "man [tool]".

# Exploiting FTP

We'll use HYDRA. 

Hydra is a very fast online password cracking tool, which can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 Protocols, including Telnet, RDP, SSH, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, several databases and much more. Hydra comes by default on both Parrot and Kali, however if you need it, you can find the GitHub here.
The syntax for the command we're going to use to find the passwords is this:

`hydra -t 4 -l dale -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV 10.10.10.6 ftp`.

# Understanding NFS

NFS stands for "Network File System" and allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network.

First, the client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory just the same way it can mount a physical device. The mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC.

The server checks if the user has permission to mount whatever directory has been requested. It will then return a file handle which uniquely identifies each file and directory that is on the server.

If someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. This call takes parameters such as:

- The file handle
- The name of the file to be accessed
- The user's, user ID
- The user's group ID

Using the NFS protocol, you can transfer files between computers running Windows and other non-Windows operating systems, such as Linux, MacOS or UNIX.

A computer running Windows Server can act as an NFS file server for other non-Windows client computers. Likewise, NFS allows a Windows-based computer running Windows Server to access files stored on a non-Windows NFS server.

# Enumerating NFS

port : 2049

Your client’s system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can create
this folder anywhere on your system. Once you've created this mount point, you can use the "mount" command to connect the NFS share to the mount point on your machine like so: 

`sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock` 

"-t" specifies the type of device to mount

IP:Share : The IP Address of the NFS server, and the name of the share we wish to mount

-nolock : Specifies not to use NLM locking

use /usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP] to list the NFS shares

we can log into the machine using `ssh -i <key-file> <username>@<ip> `

Copy the "id_rsa" key to a different location on your local machine, and change the permissions to "600" using "chmod 600 [file]".

# Exploiting NFS

## Method

This sounds complicated, but really- provided you're familiar with how SUID files work, it's fairly easy to understand. We're able to upload files to the NFS share, and control the permissions of these files. We can set the permissions of whatever we upload, in this case a bash shell executable. We can then log in through SSH, as we did in the previous task- and execute this executable to gain a root shell!

## Mapped Out Pathway:

If this is still hard to follow, here's a step by step of the actions we're taking, and how they all tie together to allow us to gain a root shell:

    NFS Access ->

        Gain Low Privilege Shell ->

            Upload Bash Executable to the NFS share ->

                Set SUID Permissions Through NFS Due To Misconfigured Root Squash ->

                    Login through SSH ->

                        Execute SUID Bit Bash Executable ->

                            ROOT ACCESS

# Understanding SMTP

mail delivery functions much the same as the physical mail delivery system. The user will supply the email (a letter) and a service (the postal delivery service), and through a series of steps- will deliver it to the recipients inbox (postbox). The role of the SMTP server in this service, is to act as the sorting office, the email (letter) is picked up and sent to this server, which then directs it to the recipient.

We can map the journey of an email from your computer to the recipient’s like this:

# Enumerating SMTP 

let's run a port scan against the target machine, same as last time. What port is SMTP running on? **25**

Okay, now we know what port we should be targeting, let's start up Metasploit with `msfconsole`

Let's search for the module "smtp_version" with : `search smtp_version`

Great, now- select the module and list the options. How do we do this? **use 0 (to take the previous command on the prompt) then just type 'options'.**

We know need to set the RHOST using `set RHOSTS [IP]` .

Noww let's search for "smtp_enum" using the same previous commands.

We're going to be using the "top-usernames-shortlist.txt" wordlist from the Usernames subsection of seclists (/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames if you have it installed).

Seclists is an amazing collection of wordlists. If you're running Kali or Parrot you can install seclists with: "sudo apt install seclists".

Now with USER_FILE : `set USER_FILE /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt`.

Now just type `run` and let metasploit do his thing. After that, a username is returned.

# Exploiting SMTP 

The syntax for the command we're going to use to find the passwords is this:

`hydra -t 16 -l USERNAME -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV MACHINE_IP ssh` whatch out cause it is case sensitive.

# Understanding MySQL

In its simplest definition, MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL).

## How does MySQL work?

MySQL, as an RDBMS, is made up of the server and utility programs that help in the administration of MySQL databases.

The server handles all database instructions like creating, editing, and accessing data. It takes and manages these requests and communicates using the MySQL protocol. This whole process can be broken down into these stages:

- MySQL creates a database for storing and manipulating data, defining the relationship of each table.
- Clients make requests by making specific statements in SQL.
- The server will respond to the client with whatever information has been requested.

# Enumerating MySQL

## The Scenario

*Typically, you will have gained some initial credentials from enumerating other services that you can then use to enumerate and exploit the MySQL service. As this room focuses on exploiting and enumerating the network service, for the sake of the scenario, we're going to assume that you found the credentials: "root:password" while enumerating subdomains of a web server. After trying the login against SSH unsuccessfully, you decide to try it against MySQL.*

*As always, let's start out with a port scan, so we know what port the service we're trying to attack is running on. What port is MySQL using?* **3306**

*Good, now- we think we have a set of credentials. Let's double check that by manually connecting to the MySQL server. We can do this using the command `mysql -h [IP] -u [username] -p`*

*Okay, we know that our login credentials work. Lets quit out of this session with "exit" and launch up Metasploit.*

*We're going to be using the "mysql_sql" module.*

*Search for, select and list the options it needs. What three options do we need to set? (in descending order).* **(Password, RHOSTS, username)
Set them (input whatever you want to).**

*Then run the exploit. By default it will test with the "select version()" command, what result does this give you?* **a mysql version**

*Great! We know that our exploit is landing as planned. Let's try to gain some more ambitious information. Change the "sql" option to "show databases". how many databases are returned?* **(`set SQL show databases` before) 4.**

# Exploiting MySQL

**the full task can be found here : https://tryhackme.com/room/networkservices2 **

*First, let's search for and select the "mysql_schemadump" module. What's the module's full name?* **auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_schemadump**

*Great! Now, you've done this a few times by now so I'll let you take it from here. Set the relevant options, run the exploit. What's the name of the last table that gets dumped?* (set RHOSTS,username and password then run) **x$waits_global_by_latency**

**In metasploit you can (when you used `use 0` come back using `back`) **

*Awesome, you have now dumped the tables, and column names of the whole database. But we can do one better... search for and select the "mysql_hashdump" module. What's the module's full name?* **auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_hashdump** 

*Again, I'll let you take it from here. Set the relevant options, run the exploit. What non-default user stands out to you?* **carl**


*Another user! And we have their password hash. This could be very interesting. Copy the hash string in full, like: bob:*HASH to a text file on your local machine called "hash.txt". (echo carl:*EA031893AA21444B170FC2162A56978B8CEECE18 > hash.txt)*

*Now, we need to crack the password! Let's try John the Ripper against it using: "john hash.txt" what is the password of the user we found?* **(we need to install the John the Ripper program using : `sudo apt install john -y` And then launch the command : `john hash.txt`) the "doggie" mdp should be returned.**


*Awesome. Password reuse is not only extremely dangerous, but extremely common. What are the chances that this user has reused their password for a different service?*

*What's the contents of MySQL.txt?* (Use ssh carl@[IP] and type the password then cat MySQL.txt) **THM{congratulations_you_got_the_mySQL_flag}**
